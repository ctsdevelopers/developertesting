Requirements and exceptions
===========================
* Make sure you have installed the OCA module 'web_widget_color'. Please use this link to clone its source code:
* Before installing the app uninstall the modules which modify Odoo web templates: e.g. remove some branding or styling. Potential contradiction may appear
* In some Odoo versions this app's installation may lead to Odoo users' group bug (users form are not opened or menus are broken). In that case just update the 'base' module
* Find themes under the menu unit Settings > Interface > Themes
